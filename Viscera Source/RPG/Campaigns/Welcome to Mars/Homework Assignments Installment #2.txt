	Salutations, loyal employee! It's time, once again, to assist Viscera in its inveterate quest to benefit humankind. All of the commissions below are purely "optional", but before deciding against them, please bear in mind that your Company has contributed substantially to the beneficial circumstances which befall your every-K life. The following assignments will be presented and assessed on the date of Chapter 5, 11-5-04

	Your duties:

		-Come dressed in character. Finding an exact match of clothing would be difficult and economically unfeasible. Instead, obtain the closest wardrobe equivalent from your closet (or someplace just as easily accessed). If anybody feels uncomfortable with this diversion from the norm, don't feel at all obligated to conform. (Optional, experience point reward.)

		-Devise a clever quote attributed to your character that neatly portrays your character's personality in some way. To provide an example, Laurell's quote is "Try to keep an open mind." (Optional, experience point reward.)

		-The Quality Control Form was extremely helpful to developing a final Viscera product. Directly prior to Chapter 5, provide as much rational criticism as possible, whether it pertains to rules, numbers, or world logistics. One objective of the test game is to understand what is wrong with the system. This is difficult to do without player interaction. (Optional, no reward.)

		-Simply because Laurell, Kayla, Reynolds, Triage, and Wild are forced to eat the same tasteless fodder K after K, does not mean that the players have to. If you wish, bring sustenatory provisions to compliment the Orpple Juice™ smoothies that will be provided by the GM. (Optional, no reward.)
