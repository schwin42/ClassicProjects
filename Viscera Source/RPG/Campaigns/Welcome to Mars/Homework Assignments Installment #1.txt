	Welcome, intrepid heroes, to your first online, interactive homework assignment! Before we get to that,
though, first we need to confirm a date for Chapters 3 and 4. After that, you can get on with your real homework 
assignments listed below.

	Your duties:

		-Check the group's calendar for the prospective dates for Chapters 3 and 4, then post a message 
on the group's board stating whether or not these dates would be feasible. (Due: 10-12-04, mandatory.)
		
		-Print out the Quality Control Form, found in the group's files section, then complete and submit 
it. (Due: 10-23-04, optional- worth 3 experience points.)

		-Compile, locate, or devise a visual representation of your character. These will be presented 
directly before Chapter 3/ You will be rewarded experience points proportional to the amount of effort apparent 
in your creation. (Due: 10-23-04, mandatory.)
