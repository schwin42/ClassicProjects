<h1>---Dude, Where's My Car Review---</h1><h4>
<center><h3>Plot</center></h3>
<p>The movie starts off with a gay little intro showing some things dancing around, things including but not limited to, cats, chicks, and other chicks. I thought this whole display with stupid and a waste of my time, but on the plus side, I was starting to be embarrassed even seeing the movie. Wait, that's not a plus. Oh, I screwed up again.
<p>After that, I think this guy Jessie wakes up and realizes that he has no idea where he was the previous evening. Then he talks to this other guy, Chester. Then this guy pees in a plant. Then they go try to find their car. And guess what? It's not anywhere to be seen. So they embark on these hi-jinks involving strippers, big-breasted high school girls, twins, rappers, Germans, nerds, potheads, and aliens that the movie entails are big-breasted, but are only average. Oh well, they still wear skintight jump suits. It's all good.
<p>In one of the funnier scenes of the movie, they encounter this cop who really sucks at his job and accidentally auctions off their car. Then they encounter this psycho black chick who laughs maniacally whenever the topic concerns the severing of body parts (My kind of chick).
<p>Of course, inevitably, Jessie and Chester realize that the world's going to end and they must figure out which alien species wants to save the universe and which one wants to blow it up. I won't spoil the "ending" by telling you which race is evil, but I will say that the finale involves a 50 ft. high really fine chick. Hell yeah.</p>
<center><h3>Hero(es) & Villain(s)</h3>
</center><p>Heroes- Jessie and Chester, apparently. But all they do is say "Dude" a lot, and feel chicks' breasts. Man, I wish I could be a hero/actor.
<p>Villains- One of the 2 alien species, though I think it's pretty obvious which after half the movie is over.
<center><h3>Best Scene</h3>
</center><p>By far, the best scene was the one where Jessie and Chester get captured under the false accusation of poaching llamas (actually ostriches). They have a dialogue with that one skinny guy with glasses on News Radio (bonus points to anyone who can give me his name), and it like saves the entire movie. <p>"Yeah, I've been in here for 328 days, 17 hours and 32 minutes, but who's counting?"
<center><h3>---Summary---
<h4>Guns- 2
</center>
<p>I don't believe this movie had any guns in it, but since I can't be 100% sure, I gave it a 2.
<h4><center>Explosions- 2
</center><p>There was probably one in there somewhere
<h4><center>Breasts- 13
</center><p>From what I perceive, the entire point of this movie was to cram as many boobs into an hour and a half as they could. Mission accomplished, baby.
<h4><center>Other- 6
</center><p>I was expecting this movie to be a lot funnier. I mean, there were some parts that were just utter hilarity, like the part when they get imprisoned for poaching llamas, but there were also parts that made me want to unlaugh, if such a thing is possible.
<center><h2>Total Score- 5.75
</center></h2><p>Bottom Line- More guns, less bad scripting.
