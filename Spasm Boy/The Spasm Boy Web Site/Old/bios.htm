<h1>The Spasm Boy Characters Page</h1>
</center><p>This page provides a breif synopsis of each character in Spasm Boy. You'd better enjoy it.</h3><h4><center>Last Updated: 1/19/01</center>

<h2>Really Big Evil Man-</h2><h4> Every hero needs an evil nemisis. Unfortunately, this is all Spasm Boy can afford. Despite his name, Really Big Evil Man isn't actually that big or evil.

Birth: Episode 1.5, Death: Episode 56, then he came back in 75.<h4>"I'm sorry, the correct answer was `P'.</h4>
