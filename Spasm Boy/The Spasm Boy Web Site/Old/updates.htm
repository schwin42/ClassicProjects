<p><b>3-9-00</b>- I updated so much that I have no energy to put it here.

<p><b>2-3-00</b>- THE SPASM BOY INTELLIGENCE TEST IS UP!! <a href=spastest.html>TAKE IT!</a>

<p><b>1-18-00</b>- I fixed a bunch of bugs on the page. Now you can actually access all the episodes I've uploaded. *mutters* Lousy people, not telling me that the site is broken.</p>
<p><b>1-13-00</b>- Whoa. I thought I already uploaded <a href=spasm.html>Episode 15</a>. Craazy. I did that finally, along with <a href=spasm.html>Episode 16</a>. I drew Episode 16, didn't like it, scrapped it, drew it again. So, this is this ultimate special revised version. You'd better like it.
<p><b>1-4-00</b>- Shit, the millenium didn't kill us all. Oh well, I guess in that case I'll keep work on Spasm Boy. Uploaded <a href=spasm.html>Episode 14</a>! It's so special!
<p><b>12-24-99</b>-Well, uploaded <a href=spasm.html>Episode 13</a> today, along with the newest update of Carl's review of Spasm Boy. Got an idea for Episode 14, the Christmas special, but it probably won't be finished for a while. Oh yeah, I wish you all a merry friggin' Christmas.
<p><b>12-17-99</b>-Uploaded <a href=spasm.html>12</a>! Today's the last day of school, so chances are there won't be a lot of Spasm Boy until I go back in January. Maybe a few episodes, but don't count on much.
<p><b>12-15-99</b>-Uploaded <a href=spasm.html>Episode 11</a> and <a href=spasm.html>Carl's review</a> of Spasm Boy. They're cool! Check 'em out!
<p><b>12-12-99</b>-I wanted to upload Episode 10 and 11 on Friday so that they'd both go on at the same time (Episode 11 is a continuation of 10), but I lost Episode 11. Well, you can still check out <a href=spasm.html>Episode 10</a>
<p><b>12-7-99</b>-<a href=spasm.html>Episode 9</a> is here! It's one of my favs. Episode 10 will be one to remember. Keep checking back!
<p><b>12-4-99</b>-Finished <a href=spasm.html>Episode 8</a> and moved my ideas that I had for Episode 8 to 9. (It just worked better that way), so Episode 9 will be the best ever!
<p><b>12-2-99</b>-Uploaded <a href=spasm.html>Episode 7</a>! It kicks ass. Episode 8 is soon to come!
<p><b>11-30-99</b>-Uploaded Episode 1 and a half! <a href=spasm.html>Check it out!</a>
<p><b>11-29-99</b>-Fixed a couple typos, thanks to my totally awesome compadre, Glenn. And that's about it. (Episode 1 and 1/2 will be coming up soon)
