<h1>Rob's Guide to Alaska</h1>
  </div>
   
<div align="Center">  
<h4>As a contrast to the usual pointless content on my web site, I decided
 to write an article that might actually be useful to someone maybe. So I
present to you, Rob's Guide to Alaska! In this article, I will touch on the
places, people, climate, exports, and attractions that you may or may not
find in Alaska.</h4>
   
<h4> </h4>

<div align="Center">  
<h3>The Places</h3>
  </div>
 &nbsp; As far as I can discern, there are only 4 cities of Alaska, all with
a population of 15+. Though the cities' names escape me, I can assure you
that they were all quite boring and lame. Each town consisted of about 3
houses, a church, and a about 80 bazillion shops that sold a "wide" variety
of "souvenirs."&nbsp; <br>
  One interesting thing about Alaska is that if you wander out of the confines
 of civilization, you are immediately halted by huge monumentous structures
 that the natives call "mountains." These "mountains" are unique in the sense
 that they have no doors or windows with which to enter. I suppose this has
 been taken as a security measure by the people who dwell inside. <br>
   
<div align="Center">  
<h3>The People</h3>
  </div>
  For the purposes of this article, I tried to get an interview with one
of  the Mountain People who supposedly lived in aforementioned "mountains".
Unfortunately,  as the Mountain People are extremely elusive, all I could
get was an interview  with one of the natives who had an extensive knowledge
of them. <br>
   
<p><b>Me:</b> So tell me, sir, when was your first encounter with the elusive
 Mountain People? </p>
  <b>Native Alaskan:</b> What? <br>
  <br>
  <b>Me:</b> So tell me, sir, when was your first encounter with the elusive
 Mountain People? <br>
  <br>
  <b>Native Alaskan:</b> No, I heard you, I just didn't- <br>
  <br>
  <b>Me:</b> I see, so you are trying to waste my time? <br>
  <br>
  <b>Native Alaskan:</b> Waste your time? But you were- <br>
  <br>
  <b>Me:</b> You're in cahoots with the Mountain People, aren't you? <br>
  <br>
  <b>Native Alaskan:</b> What are you talking- <br>
  <br>
  <b>Me:</b> Aren't you!? <br>
  <br>
  After that, he tried to run away, but I was able to subdue him and put
him  in a sack. I had written down an itinerary concerning what I was supposed
 to do after I'd put him in the sack, but I lost it. I also lost the sheet
 of paper with the location that I left that sack when I got bored of looking
 for the itinerary. <br>
  But enough about the mountain people. After monitoring the goings-on in 
a typical Alaskan city, I was able to figure out that 98% of the people in
 Alaska are tourists, and the other 2% are outcasts from the rest of the
planet,  thus making Alaska a hole of worthlessness that no one should ever
go to.*  <br>
  *Note to people from Alaska: The previous statement was in regard to a
different  Alaska on a different planet.**<br>
  **Note to people that do not live in Alaska: I'm really not.<br>

<h3>The Climate</h3>
   
<div align="Left">Contrary to popular belief, Alaska is a very cold place.&nbsp;
Of course, when I say "very cold", I am grossly underexaggerating. Imagine&nbsp;
walking to a freezer buck-naked, on Pluto, in a snowstorm. Obviously, it
is somewhat impossible for a snowstorm to exist centralized inside of a freezer,&nbsp;
but yes, it's that cold. If you are ever looking to get away from it all
and are staggeringly unintelligent, Alaska is the place.<br>
  <br>
   
<div align="Center">  
<h3>The Exports</h3>
   
<div align="Left">It seems to me that the cheif exports of Alaska are as
follows: mangled pieces of wood that "resemble" various animals, shot glasses
with comical illustrations, and ice. Now, you're probably wondering what
more any person would want from a state, but I contest that this is surprisingly
 little for a state of Alaska's size.You see, while all the other 49 states 
are pulling their weight economically, Alaska is selling snow-cones and the 
like globalwide and making a gross profit of $6 yearly. My advice to Alaska 
is to start programs that support more profitable ventures, such as BEF (Burning 
Eskimos for Fuel) and WAGHLOLKBIF (We Are Going to Hurt Little Kids Because 
It's Fun).<br>
 
<div align="Center"> 
<h3>The Attractions</h3>
 There are no attractions in Alaska. Sorry.<br>

<h4>Well, that concludes my article, and I hope you've learned as much as 
I have. Though I don't know why I'd learn anything, because I wrote the article 
from my previous knowledge and fragments of dreams I had. Anyway, I do have 
one last thing to show you. Yes, I will now exhibit some of the incredible 
photos I took while in Alaska!</h4>

 As you can see by this sign, Alaskan have an unhealthy intolerance for fecal 
matter of any kind.<br>

 There may be some hope for Alaskans yet, as they have ingeniously come to 
the conclusion that you will sell burgers if you have a monarch in establishment's 
name. <br>
 <br>
 
<div align="Center"> 
<h4>Well, that's all I have on Alaska. For more information, consult your 
local library. But they'll probably tell you horrible lies about Alaska and 
crush your bones to make their bread. Or something, I dunno. </h4>
