<center><h1>Links to Better Places</h1></center>
<h4>Welcome to my page of links. All of these places have been personally approved by the aliens inside my head. Therefore, the following sites are quite possibly the greatest in the world.*</h4>
<h6>*I have been known to lie.<h5>Last Updated: 1-19-01</h5></center>
<h5><a href=http://sphinx27.freeservers.com/index.html>http://sphinx27.freeservers.com/index.html</a>-This my friend Mike's site, it's pretty cool. Check it out, you won't regret it, baby.
<h5><a href="http://www.cafepress.com">Cafe Press</a>-This place is cool, it lets you merchandise your own worthless crap. Coincidentially, this is where I sell the Spasm Boy merchandise from.
<h5><a href="http://www.misterpoll.com">Mister Poll</a>- This is the provider for the Spasm Boy Web Poll. If you need a poll, this is a place to go.
<h5><a href="http://maduin.yi.org/~dr/"><img src="http://maduin.yi.org/~dr/graphics/ravenlink.gif"></a>-My "friend" Brenden's stupid page. I suppose it's pretty good for killing time. I mean, it's not like you have anything better to do, you're here, aren't you?
<h5><a href=http://www.webrpg.com><img src="http://www.webrpg.com/badge2.gif" alt="WebRPG Online" width=104 height=34 border=0></a>-I love this place. Once you download the software, you can chat and play AD&D and other RPGs over the web! (Recommended)
<h5><a href="http://www.somethingawful.com"><img src="http://www.somethingawful.com/inserts/graphics/logo.gif"></a>- Lowtax's kickass web site. Like 50 times funnier than mine, but you should still come to mine, because I'll shoot the hostage if you don't. *puts gun to hostage's head* IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT??</p>
<h5><a href="http://sailormoonman.homestead.com"><img src="http://www.homestead.com/sailormoonman/publishImages/Banner_Ad_Index2_10085.gif"></a>- One of my friend Patrick's friend's web site. You know, surprising enough, that previous sentence was grammatically correct. It just doesn't make any sense.
<p>
<h5><a href=index.html><img src=graphics/spasgif.gif></a>- Well, here ya go. It's the best I could do. If you link to my site, I'll gladly link to yours. Be sure to <a href="mailto:fizzwozzler@hotmail.com?subject=Link exchange">let me know</a>.</p>
