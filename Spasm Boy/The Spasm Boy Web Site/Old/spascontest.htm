<h1>The Spasm Boy Contest Page!</h1>
<p>Last Updated: 1-19-00</p>
<h3>Wow, do I have a contest for you! I don't know. Let me check.
</h3><h3>Hmm... seems I don't. Well, you can enter this other one instead. The point of this contest is to come up with the best idea for a Spasm Boy contest!</3></center><h2>The Terms-</h2><h4>Please name your contest, describe it in detail, and feel free to include some sort of picture or something, because I like to look at pretty pictures.</h4>
<h2>The Prizes-</h2><h4> The winner of this fabulous contest will win a free AUTOGRAPHED HUNDRED EPISODE CD. Yessir, all one hundred episodes onto a CD, along with some special other stuff that you can only find on this awesome collection! Additionally, your contest could be used as featured Spasm Boy contest, and I'll probably put your name on this page or something. I dunno, I haven't thought this through very well.</h4>
<h2>The Fine Print-</h2><h4> Hey, make sure you include your name and email address, and send all entries to <a href=mailto:"fizzwozzler@hotmail.com">fizzwozzler@hotmail.com</a>. This contest will close and a winner will be announced on the completion of all 100 Spasm Boy episodes (and thus, the creation of the CD). The winning contest might be modified slightly* to allow for any changes to the storyline after the entry was made.</h4>
<h6>*Incredibly</h6><center>
<h4>So what are you waiting for? Get on it! You could be the only person to ever have an autographed hundred episode CD! Oh, and also, if you can help think of a better name than "Hundred Episode CD", I'd appreciate any suggestions.</h4>
