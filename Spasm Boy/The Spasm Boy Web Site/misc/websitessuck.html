<h1>Web Sites Suck</h1>
<h4>The inspiration for this article came to me when I was wondering what I should update on my stagnant and turbid swamp of an excuse for an online craphole (my web site). I pondered for some 7 hours when it occured to me that all of this sucked, so to speak. And then ding! A light bulb went on in my brain. After the team of surgeons were able to remove it, restoring partial motor functions, I thought of this.</h4>
<h3>The Meaning</h3></center>
<p>I am writing this article to steer away anyone from ever creating a web site on the internet. If you already have one, I'm afraid it is too late for you. However, if you are currently site-less, then hopefully I can be of some service. Though I severely doubt it.</p>
<h3>The Experience</h3></center>
<p> After owning this web site (in some shape or form) for twice the term of my natural life, I can safely assume that I'm the authority on running an unsuccessful web site without any prior knowledge of anything. The following will shock and amaze you, and may give you a headache if you aren't wearing glasses and you should be, but it my duty to provide you, the internet surfers, with a big fat road hazard sign that says "NO NO NO".
<p>The first thing about owning a web site is the obligation to put interesting content on it. Now, if you're like me, and I know I am, you should be drawing a blank faster than.. uh... um, something that draws blanks really fast, like an electric blank drawer or something. Anyawy, once this happens, you'll be forced to write inane and retarded articles like "How to Get Free Stuff From the Dairy Queen" and "My Trip to the Dance". Nobody wants to see that.
<p>The second thing is the sheer maintenance involved; making sure links aren't dead, making sure people are visiting, realizing that people aren't visiting, crying because people are visiting. You know, that's a lot of work for someone who spends most of his time crying about other, much more important things like the fact that Santa Claus isn't real and that the Tooth Fairy is, at best, a prostitute with a tooth-wand. I forgot what my main point was. Let's move on.
<p>And the single, worst thing about owning a web site, is the complete and utter apathy from anyone you try to get to look at your site. For example:
<p><b>Me:</b> Hey, wanna check out my web site?
<p><b>Person #1:</b> Yeah sure whatever bye.
<P><b>Me:</b> But I didn't give you the address yet.
<p><b>Person #2:</b> Who are you talking to dude? He already left.
<p><b>Me:</b> Do <u>you</u> want to check out my web site??
<p><b>Person #2:</b> Uh... no.
<p><b>Me:</b> Are you sure? I can be very... persuasive...
<p><b>Person #2:</b> Rape!
<p>See what I mean? You go to all the time and effort to throw together a pile of garbage and what are you rewarded with? Nothing. 
<h3>The Conclusion</h3></center>
<p>In conclusion, (which is probably redundant, as I already pointed out in the heading that this would be a conclusion) unless you have $63 trillion to invest into a landfill of an internet homestead, those of you who wish to waste your time constructing a web site will be sorely disappointed.
<p>In more conclusion, I would like to note that this article does not indicate the death of <u>my</u> internet craphole. I can assure you that I will update as often as I feel like it, which will probably be once or twice every coming of Jesus.
