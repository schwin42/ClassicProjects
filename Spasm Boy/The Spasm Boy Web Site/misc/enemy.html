<h1>---Enemy at the Gates Review---</h1><h3>Plot</center></h3>
<p>The movie opens up to a train or some really big bus that goes on tracks with doors and things flying around. I'm not sure. So anyway, you're introduced to this Russian guy, Vassily Zieklev that can shoot up people from 3 miles away, blindfolded, hands tied behind his back, without a gun, in the snow, dead. Maybe not like that, but he's really good at shooting things.
<p>So anyway, this guy starts to shoot people and this other guy says "Hey, Russian people need a hero, because they're dying way too much for my liking." and so this Vassily guy starts shooting people professionally. Or maybe he was before, and he just got a raise in pay or something. But isn't that against Communism? Maybe he was paid under the table and the Russian government used Sputnik or something to wire funds to his secret Swiss account in Texas.
<p>After a while, this Dasilov guy (Vassily's friend) meets this chick, Tania and starts to fall in love. Meanwhile, Vassily hears about this German sniper, Major Koenig, who's trying to kill him.
<p>All these people have stupid names. If I went around saying my name was Fatsov McScrew-ov, people would throw rocks at me. From now on, Vassily's name is Tom, Dasilov's name is Ed, Tania's name is Ann Marie, and Koenig's name is Papa John. Mm... sniper pizza.
<p>Also, the word "Stalingrad" kept appearing everywhere all over the place. I think it was the brand of cola the Russians drank before Pepsi was invented. I can see the ad slogan now.
<p><i>"Stalingrad- MISERABLE COWARD, DRINK IT OR DIE!!!"</i>
<p>So anyway, some people die and things explode. People read newspapers that are printed in French or Italian or something, and George Bush starts his presidential campaign.
<p>At the end of the movie, there is a confrontation between Tom and Papa John, and some people die. YOU'LL HAVE TO WATCH THE MOVIE TO FIND OUT WHO!!
<center><h3>Hero(es) & Villain(s)</h3>
</center><p>Hero- I don't know. I guess Tom. It kinda depends on whether you're rooting for a Communist dictatorship where lots of people are killed or a German dictatorship where lots of people are killed. At least the German people don't have stupid last names, Mr. Malchavodomstovik.
<p>Villains- George Bush, though he doesn't appear in the movie, as far as I can discern.
<center><h3>Best Scene</h3>
</center><p>Hmm... that's a good question, though nobody asked any questions and I can't remember what I'm doing. I think my favorite scene was the very last one, with the confrontation between the evil sniper and the evil sniper who works for the Italians or the Canadians or the Texans or someone. Lots of things get shot at. I liked it.
<center><h3>---Summary---
<h4>Guns- 11

<p>Everything with a trigger killed something. Everyone with a head got it shot in at one point or another.
<h4><center>Explosions- 9
</center><p>Seems like when things weren't getting shot at, they were being exploded or exploding something else.<h4><center>Breasts- 2
</center><p>
It's hard to be disappointed at this aspect when there is blood constantly splattered everywhere in the movie. People say the public is desensitized towards violence, but BLOOD I really can't GUNS see how that KILL would be possibleDESTROY.
<h4><center>Other- 6
</center><p>When the inital shock of the movie wears off, it's not much more than a blur of gunshots and explosions. Sure, I like violence as much as the next person, but... well I can't think of a "but" to that. I guess I'm saying that's all the movie had.
<center><h2>Total Score- 7
</center></h2><p>Bottom Line- More Russian conscripts in bikinis, less cola.
