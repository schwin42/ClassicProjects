<h1>The Reason "Life Sucks" was Taken Down</h1></center>
<p>If you visit this web site regularly, you'll notice that the "Life Sucks" article was recently taken down. Of course, like everything else I do, there's a perfectly good reason behind this.
<p>Apparently, according to the huge response that I got from people who read the article, I didn't write the article in a way that people could blatently tell that it was fictional.
<p>Though my dad actually does have bone cancer, the way in which I portrayed my feelings about this were misconstrewed, and that's all I'll say about that.
<p>As with the theorum I devised, I wasn't trying to suggest that people go out and brutalize/murder people, nor was I trying to suggest that I was about to go do these things myself. What this part of my article was intended to do is portray myself as an idiot, thus, the humor contained within the article would be because of ridicule directed at me.
<p>In the latter part of my article, my objective was to come off mildly hyporitical of stupid people, and I just threw old people onto the list to add an obscure part that just didn't make a lot of sense. I have been informed that I came off as a bigot against old people and that simply isn't true.
<p>As for the suggestion to "Kill yourself" at the end, I merely threw that in because I needed something concise to end the article.
<p>In conclusion, I didn't write the article to express any deep feelings I had or to influence people to hurt others. Everything found on this web site (with the exception of this article) is purely meant for the purposes of humor. I appreciate the emails of those who called me on this blunder of mine, and I will try to keep my humor more factual, or at least appearing that way.
