<h1>---Saving Silverman Review---</h1>
<h3>Plot</h3></center>
<p>The plot basically consists of this lovestruck dumbass, Silverman, who falls in love with
this total she-bitch, Judith (Amanda Peet, who does a brilliant job portraying a bitch). So
then Silverman's friends have to save him (hence the title). Anyway, all these hi-jinks
eventually involve kidnapping, digging up bodies, blowing up cars, shooting people/animals
with tranquilizer darts, cursing, and some other stuff, I forget.
<p>I found the following quote on the internet or somewhere, from a review of Saving Silverman
<p><i>"Kick boxing deaths and conflicted nuns are not the makings of a good comedy."</i>
<p>Could this guy be more wrong? Of course, the answer is no. Not if a bunch of flying monkeys
flew up his butt and started infecting him with some kind of flying-monkey-up-the-butt virus
which causes you to be extremely wrong about everything, could this guy be more wrong. In
fact, on a scale of one to wrong, one being the wrongest anyone could ever be about
anything, and wrong being even wronger, this man has acheived a whopping eleven. Whatever
the hell that means.
<p>I can't even remember what my original point was, but the word "Wrong" keeps flashing in my
head. Perhaps my brain is critisizing me again.
<center><h3>Hero(es) & Villain(s)</h3>
</center>
<p>Heroes- That fat guy and the ugly guy whose real and fake names both fail to make it
to the part of my brain which types it onto the word... making thing are both heroes of
some calibur. They both rock. I hope I'm cool enough to get mauled by a racoon or beat up by
a woman when I grow up.
<p>Villain- Evil bitch, Amanda Peet. She's like the sexy version of the devil. And not like
a sexy man version. That would be just... not fun. Most of the following breasts score
comes from her gracing the movie with her boobies- I mean, presence. *thought* No, I meant
whatever I said before the thing that I just said.
<center><h3>Best Scene</h3></center>
<p>Any of the scenes with that awesome coach. The coach just kicks ass.
<p>Right before a big game, the coach gives a motivational speech
   <p><i> "Arite boys, there are 2 things you need to know in life. One: Women are the devil.
All they want from you is your man-seed. Any urges you can't subdue with large amounts
of hard liquor, you can handle with this. *motions to hand* Two: Um.. something about
teamwork."
</i>
<p>See what I mean?
<center><h3>---Summary---</h3></center><h4>
<center><p>Guns- 6
<p>I think this movie deserves a reasonable guns score for managing to work in a gun with
tranquilizer darts into most of the scenes of this movie.
<center><p>Explosions- 5</center>
<p>One totally cool explosion where they push a car off a cliff. Plus some others where there
isn't really any fire, but by definition, they're explosions.
<p><center>Breasts- 11</center>
<p>Amanda Peet is almost hot enough to break the 13 that Dude, Where's My Car got, but not
quite. Sorry Amanda, but I'll still sleep with you if it'll make you feel better.
  <center><p>Other- 14</center>
<p>Cursing Nuns, Amanda kicking the crap out of every guy in the movie, nachos. I mean, what
more do you want? Like a big fat Amanda in a nun costume with nacho hat? Pff, now that's
just silly.
<center><h2>Total Score- 9.0</h2></center>
Bottom Line- Funniest movie ever conceived. You will literally go to hell if you don't see
this movie. Or if you do.   ...One of the two.</h4>
