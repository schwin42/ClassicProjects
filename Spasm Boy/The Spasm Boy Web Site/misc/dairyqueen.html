<h1>Conspiracy - Free Stuff from the Dairy Queen</h1>
</center><h4>If you're someone as observant as me, sometimes you start to see the little holes in the system. After gaining consciousness in front of the Dairy Queen a few towns over a couple days ago, I devised a plan to get the Dairy Queen to give you free...whatever it is they sell. Probably cows, that sounds right.</h4>
<h4>Unlike the previous Conspiracy, anyone can use this one! Just follow the steps below and you'll be drinking fresh cow in no time.

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p><b>Own the Dairy Queen</b>
<p>This being the most open-ended of my steps, there are a number of ways to accomplish this. You can assume the identity of the owner, like they did in Body Snatchers, you can take the deed from the owner after pushing him down a flight of stairs, you can consume narcotics until you believe that you own the Dairy Queen. Really, the possibilities are endless.
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p><b>Fire All Employees</b>
<p>The last thing you need right now is a bunch of worthless "employees" tying up all your funds. Fire them all. If they ask such trivial questions as "Can I get a letter of recommendation?" or "Why are you doing this?", fire them again, and push them into a lake.
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p><b>Hire Elephants to Work for Peanuts</b>
<p>Now that you've got a store that's free from slack-jawed riff raff, hire elephants to take their places. Make sure to thoroughly interview every elephant, or else they'll know something's up. Once you have a respectable workforce of elephants, move on to step 4.
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p><b>Burn Down Dairy Queen and Collect on Insurance</b>
<p>Pick a random day to burn down your Dairy Queen. Do not tell the elephants you are going to do this, or they'll become suspicious. When the insurance man comes up to you and asks what happened, blame the elephants for the horrible fire and collect on the dough (laymen's terms: money). Note: If at this point, you forgot to buy insurance, go back to Step 1.
<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p><b>Spend Money to Rebuild Dairy Queen, Kill Elephants Who Know Too Much</b>
<p>Once you have your large amount of cash, spend it to rebuild the Dairy Queen. If the elephants start asking questions or files depicting your plan start mysteriously "disappearing" be sure to take care of (murder) the problem.
<h3>Step 6</h3>
<p><b>Sell Dairy Queen to Old Woman</b>
<p>Find an old senile woman (the older the better) and sell her the Dairy Queen. Once she gets things running smoothly, proceed to step 7.
<h3><strike>Step7</strike></h3>
<h3>Step 8</h3>
<p><b>Take Free Cows from Dairy Queen</b>
<p>Now you see while finding a really old person was important. If the woman can still see you taking things, she's not old enough. Just in case she does, though, make up an excuse like "These are my cows." or "I'm taking your cows from you."
<p>Well, there you have it! Now, intelligence indicates that the Dairy Queen may not sell cows, but these:

<p>Now I have no idea what this is, but I have constructed a vivid formula that explains why I do not believe the Dairy Queen sells cows.

<h4>So when you're sipping that nice hat or whatever it is, just think about the man who brought it all to you. <h4>Whoever that is.
