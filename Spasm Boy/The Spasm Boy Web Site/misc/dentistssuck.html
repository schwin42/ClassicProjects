<h1>Dentists Suck</h1>
<h4>Since the beginning of time, dentists have roamed the Earth, preying on pathetic creatures such as you and I. Back then, they had razor sharp claws instead of drills, and septic tanks instead of waiting rooms. Asides from that, not much has changed.</h4>
<h3>The Reason</h3></center>
<p>I didn't write this article merely because my web site desperately needed content. Well, actually, I did. But the reason I wrote this article as opposed to "Why Bananas Are Yellow: A Complacent Look at Mother Nature's Thick-Skinned Child" is because I recently had two sucky trips to everyone's favorite torturous demon- the dentist.
<center><h3>The Dentist- Part 1</h3></center>
<p>Upon my entry to the dentist's office, just a few weeks ago, I realized I was in store for a fate that I could not possibly imagine. Well, I had some idea of what kind of fate, because I was in there just a few months prior, but other than that, I had was pretty clueless. Like always.
<p>So I signed in and waited for about 4 months, reading articles along the lines of "How Can You Lose Weight" and "Will Bush Be a Good President?" and "Is This Article a Waste of Your Time and Money?". Afterwards, they told me that I didn't have an appointment that day. Now, if I had an ounce of intelligence in any part of my body, I would have left. But nooooooooooooooo, I had to argue with them and pull out the little card they give you that proved I had an appointment. They eventually believed me and told me I could see the dentist. For about 4/5ths of a second, I thought I'd won a small victory in my life. For the next 2 hours, I started to think otherwise.
<p>After waiting for a few more eternities in the dentist's chair (or Chair O' Doom, as I like to call it), the dentist showed up and proceed to poke my gums with sharp objects. Apparently, he was testing to see how much blood he could get out of my gums. Either that or he was an incompentant moron who couldn't keep the pick on those white dealies in my mouth.
<p>Upon bleeding my gums dry, he told me that I had a cavity that had to be filled. He told me to make an appointment for a couple days later, so he could fill it.
<center><h3>The Dentist- Part 2</h3></center>
<p>When I came back to the dentist, he was confused as to what he was doing. He asked his assistant if he was just filling the two cavities. She said that it was only one cavity. He said "Ah, of course. Number 12?" he said, referring to a tooth. "No. Number 16." At this point, it had come to my realization that I was extremely frightened to have this man drill holes in my teeth when he couldn't remember a two-digit number with any degree of accuracy. But what was I supposed to do? Run out of the place, screaming? ...Yes, yes I was.
<p>He then proceeded to shoot me up with novocaine. Apparently, he wasn't confident enough with this, because he gave me 2 more shots in the same place. He then said "If you feel anything, be sure to let me know."
<p>Of course, I expected the whole procedure to be filled with blinding pain, but what I didn't expect is for the tooth he filled to <u>still</u> hurt 3 weeks later. I should sue for malpractice. Better yet, I should go to his house and start drilling in his teeth and see how he likes it.
<center><h3>Avoiding the Dentist</center></h3>
<p>I'm sure your parents or children or pets are telling you "If you don't want to go to the dentist, then brush your teeth." Don't listen to that fiddle-faddle. If you <u>really</u> want to avoid having some inept moron inflict pain on you, strap a bomb to yourself the day of your appointment and threaten to "blow them all to hell" if anyone gets close to you. Then start making demands.
<p>Well, there you go. I hope you enjoyed my limitless insight.
