<h1>---My Night at the Dance (March 3rd, 2001)---</h1>
</center><p>Dear Diary,
<p>Wait, that sounds too gay.
<p>Dear Fucking Diary,
today sucked.
<h3>Background</h3></center>
<p>A couple days/weeks/months ago, I heard about this dance, Hearts & Flowers, where the chicks ask the guys to it (as opposed to
 the guys asking chicks), and for several days, not a single girl asked me out. No kidding! I know, me! Can you believe it?
They were all probably intimidated by my stunning physique or my witty... um, wit. So anyway, then this girl Mallory asked me!
 However, she had an underhanded plan that led straight to disaster! Well, it didn't lead straight to disaster, we to had to
 take a detour on indifference and then turned south on mango.
<p>It turns out that Becca (a person), intended on setting up a double date of sorts with her date, Adam. Of course, I
figured everything that starts with the word double must be good! Those damn Double Mint Commercials must have rotted my
mind.
<p>It eventually turned out that Adam and Becca couldn't actually attend the dance (for reasons too boring to describe), but
decided that they would go to dinner and a movie with us beforehand. So Mallory and I bought tickets the day before and now
were ready for fun! Little did I know what I was in store for... DISASTER!
<h3>Day of the Dance</h3>
<p>Well, my day was pretty uneventful until about 4 when I decided I should start getting ready (considering I was supposed
to meet Adam, Becca, and Mallory at the movies in ten minutes). So anyway, after I was done making myself presentable, I
figured that I'd probably need my school ID to get into this dance, so I looked around for it frantically until I gave up
and decided that if I didn't leave then, I'd probably miss them. I arrived and my mother loaded me full of cash (\\$45).
I purchaced my ticket to Monkey Bone (which wasn't extremely good, as you'll note from my review) and walked over to
my date and our doubles, where we proceeded to talk about how everyone looked better than me.
<p>Wow, this is more boring than I thought it'd be. I think I'll just make up the parts that are too lame to mention.
<p>So then the theatre burned to the ground and everyone thanked me for saving the day and the mayor gave me the key to the
city and a supermodel made out of chocolate. After that, it was about 7 and we decided to walk over to Monache (school I go
to) to take pictures. But what I didn't realize is that pictures spelled.............DISASTER
<p>Adam and Becca were also going to take pictures, but they didn't have a ticket to the dance (which they evidently needed).
So then they left and I started cracking jokes about how it would be funny if they made the couples pose pornigraphically for the pictures.
Then the vampires jumped in and threatened to blow up the building so I tricked them into looking at themselves in the
mirror and they all turned to dust and the mayor gave me another chocolate supermodel.
<p>So then Adam and Becca and Mallory and I made our way to Lyon's (a restaurant) where we were going to eat dinner. I
ordered some kind of pasta dealy and wasn't competent enough to eat it. I swear, they should hand out bibs at restaurants.
So then we paid and left the restaurant and decided to walk back to the school, (Only a block away) when the ninjas jumped
out of the bushes! I made quick work of the first 3, but then the one wearing all red had a gun and claws and magic powers.
So I tricked him into getting a job at Save Mart. He got fired today! After arriving at the dance, a mean lady prompty yelled
"CAN I SEE YER FREAKIN ID???????" and I was like "Dude, I lost mine." and she was all "I'LL KILL YOU!!!" so we ran. I
apologized to Mallory for ruining her evening, and felt really bad. She said it was OK and everything, but whatever. We
decided to meet back up with Adam and Becca (who were going to meet Luis at 10:30 back at Lyon's), and we saw them walking
back.
<p>Of course, my train of though was "OK, if she doesn't hate you now, she'll be fine walking with you back there, but if she
 secretly wants you dead, she'll get their attention." Seconds later, I heard her yell "Becca! Hey, we're back here!"
...Disaster.
<p>Of course then I heard a little boy screaming for help so I flew and saved him from the insect lord who was about to
devour the little boy whole. Then the mayor gave me a million dollars, a Mercedes Benz, and a bucket of virgin blood.
<p>The rest of the evening was basically a Pandora's box filled with garbage and old people, since we just sat around at
Lyon's waiting for Luis and his stupid friend, then walked halfway across town aimlessly, before I called my mom at 12 to
come pick us up. Um.. disaster?
<center><h3>Moral of the Freakin' Story</h3></center><h4>
<p>Of course, the moral of the story is to never advise ninjas with magic powers to seek employment, as they will probably
get fired and be demoralized for life. Oh yeah, and don't forget your ID when going to a dance, or some bitch will yell at
you and your date will hate you forever.
