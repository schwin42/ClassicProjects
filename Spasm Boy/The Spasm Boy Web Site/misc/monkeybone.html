<h1>---Monkey Bone Review---</h1><h3>Plot</center></h3>
<p>Hm... where shall I begin? I dunno. I can't really remember what the movie was about, I watched like a couple years or months or weeks ago or something. OK, well I'll just fill in the blanks with frosting. Like Oreos! I like Oreos. I wish I had some right now.
<p>The movie starts out with the introduction of Stu Miley's (Get it?? S.Miley?? Isn't that hilarious??? LAUGH, GOD DAMNIT) extremely stupid idea for a cartoon, Monkey Bone. And everyone loves him and wants him to market a bunch of worthless merchandise for his stupid monkey. Then somehow he gets into coma and winds up in "Downtown", this stupid place with a lot of stupid people. And he has to get out of it before they pull the dreaded plug. Yeah, that's basically the plot. And the rest is too lame to describe.
<p>This being a movie with Brenden Fraser, and a nonsensical plot, I naturally assumed it would be a laugh riot. Boy, was I wrong! Yes, I was. This movie just felt like it tried too hard. Like it was trying to crap out humor and was just crapping out... crap.
<center><h3>Hero(es) & Villain(s)</h3>
</center><p>Hero- Stu, played by Brenden Frasier. He's not really a hero, just some guy that wants this chick.
<p>Villain- Probably Monkey Bone, although I've never seen a villain who actually acheives these dangerous levels of suckage. Like levels of suckage so high that the 10 mile radius in which he occupied would be taped with police line, and wouuld be queued as high priority for nuclear dispatch. And when I say high priority, I mean like right after George Bush finishes blowing up Iraq or France or whatever he was trying to hit.
<center><h3>Best Scene</h3>
</center><p>When I think of the best scene from a movie, I usually think of which scene was the most hilarious or which scene destroyed the most stuff via bullets, C4, or otherwise. In this movie however, there weren't a whole lot of redeeming features for any of the scenes. Then I remembered Kitty. Ah yes, Kitty. She's this cat-chick who appears in a few scenes and lends her great acting abilities (breasts) to the movie.
<p>So I'd have to say my favorite scene was the one that introduces Kitty and Monkey Bone and all these other stupid characters, because Kitty is in it. For some reason, a chick purring just really turned me on.
<center><p><i>"Purrrrrrrrrr...."</i></center>
<center><h3>---Summary---
<h4>Guns- 1
<p>Regardless of whether or not there were guns (there weren't), this movie deserves a one here.
<h4><center>Explosions- 1
</center><p>Not only did this movie have no explosions, it's not worthy of my time to think up a pithy insult to put here.
<h4><center>Breasts- 9
</center><p>Kitty...
<h4><center>Other- 2
</center><p>This movie sucked. I hope it falls off a bridge and burns in a car accident.<center><h2>Total Score- 3.25
</center></h2><p>Bottom Line- More kitty, less... everything else.
