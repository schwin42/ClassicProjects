<h1>Love Sucks</h1>
<h4>As anyone who's ever had relations with one of the opposite sex knows, love sucks. In this article, I'm not going to focus so much on why love sucks, but the intricacies of this natural phenomenon.
</h4>
<h3>Why Love Sucks</h3></center>
<p>Yeah, I know I just said that I wasn't going to focus on why it sucks, but I feel an article of this "depth" needs some background.
<p>If you've ever had a relationship that's ended horribly with one or more of the parties crushed eternally, raise your hand. Good, none of you. Because if you had raised your hand, you'd be some kind of idiot. Anyway, my point is that love usually doesn't end the way the people involved think it will at the beginning. 
<p>But anyway, for some reason or another, when people fall in love, 95% of the time, someone gets hurt. That's why love sucks.
<p>At this point, you may be asking "Well then, why do people keep falling in love if it's such a horrible experience?" I'm getting to that, calm down.

<center><h3>The Women</h3></center>
<p>For a relationship to work, it usually requires one man and one woman. Unless you're a lesbian, in which case you can send video footage <a href="mailto:fizzwozzler@hotmail.com">here</a>. But anyway, what do females have to gain from this emotional turmoil? The truth is, I have no clue. Why on earth would some chick want a smelly, moronic, ugly pile of hormones such as a member of the male species. It boggles the mind. Fortunately for the human race, women are attracted to men somehow. Maybe it's some kind of female hormone that kicks in whenever anything completely unworthy of them happens into proximity. I dunno.



<center><h3>The Men</h3></center>
<p>And of course, there are the males. Conversly, since men have nothing to offer women, what is it that attracts the male species into this death trap we call love? What a ridiculously stupid question. Needless to say, breasts. That's right. Our thought processes are limited to "Does subject have breasts?" if so "Is subject man in disguise as woman?". If the answer is "no" or "probably not", then comes "Commence asking subject out to date."

<center><h3>Avoiding the Inevitable</center></h3>
<p>If you're somehow in a relationship that you'd really like to stay in, take my advice and not let them break up with you. Use tactics of confusion and avoidance to trap them into your diabolical relationship. Observe a sample conversation.

<p><b>Jane:</b> John, I think we need to talk.
<p><b>John:</b> I disagree.
<p><b>Jane:</b> Our relationship isn't working out.
<p><b>John:</b> Nice weather we're having.
<p><b>Jane:</b> Are you even listening to me? I think we need to break up.
<p><b>John:</b> Break up what?
<p><b>Jane:</b> Our relationship.
<p><b>John:</b> What about it?
<p><b>Jane:</b> I'm breaking up with you!!
<p><b>John shoots the hostage</b>

<p>See? It might even work without the hostage, there's a first time for everything.
