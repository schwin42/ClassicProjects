<h1>Conspiracy - Global Domination with Mentos</h1>
</center><h4>After years of careful planning, I&#8217;ve finally constructed the ideal plan to take over the Earth and possibly Canada. As many of you know from their colorful commercials, Mentos grants magic powers. With the help of Mentos and my dastardly brilliant plan, no one will be able to stop me!</h4>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p><b>Buy Mentos</b>
<p>Although I'm not quite sure on how to purchase some Mentos, I'm assuming it's not much different than purchasing cocaine. I just have to use one of my connections to find a Mentos dealer in my area, pay him with my earnings from begging on street corners, and then I'm on to phase two of my brilliant plan!
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p><b>Eat Mentos and Acquire Superpowers</b>
<p>After purchasing said Mentos, I will move onto one of the most delicate parts of plan: ingesting them. You see, I have eye-hand coordination that rivals that of some species of rocks. Thus, eating the aforementioned Mentos could be a task, taking weeks, possibly even days. Anyway, once I eat them and gain the power of superhuman tolerance for pain or superhuman intelligence or superhuman something else, I can move on to stage three of my conspiracy!
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p><b>Impress President George Bush with Superpowers</b>
<p>Once I have my superpowers, I will arrange a dinner with President George Bush, by "calling" him on my telephone device. On the night of the dinner, I will propose a toast. It will go something like this:
<p><i>"To President George Bush!"</i>
<p>Then I&#8217;ll pull the tablecloth off the table and jump out the window and use it as a parachute and then I&#8217;ll land and pull the Mentos package out and the announcer will go "Mentos: The Freshmaker" and then everyone will applause and President Bush will be like "You're my new first mate! Set a course, Dr. Schwin, warp 5." Then I'll go "Aye aye, cap'n!"
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p><b>Do Away with President George Bush and Assume an Iron Grip on the US</b>
<p>When President George Bush trusts me well enough, I'll do away with him by punching him with a boxing glove or shoving him out a window. Then when he goes missing, I'll write up a phony will, which states that I will become the new king of the US. On to part five!
<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p><b>Slay Congress</b>
<p>Now that I'm ruler of the US, I can't very well have Congress getting in my way. I will decree that the US Navy slay congress, and while Congress is bitching about whether this is constitutional or not, they'll all be blown up by some huge bomb that I planted in the rafters!
<h3>Step 6</h3>
<p><b>Hide on Mars, Launch Nuclear Devices at Earth, and Videotape Apocalypse</b>
<p>With Congress gone, my tyrannical rule of the US will be unhindered. That is, until I blow it up. I will create a base on Mars and stock it with a bunch of nuclear weapons purchased from Iraq. Then, I will shoot them all at Earth and video tape the resulting explosions.
<h3>Step 7</h3>
<p><b>Populate Earth with More Humans</b>
<p>At this point in my plan, I will somehow get more humans to live on earth.
<h3>Step 8</h3>
<p><b>Sell Footage of Nuclear Explosions to Humans</b>
<p>Once the Earth is once again bustling with movie directors, I'll sell the footage of the nuclear devastation that wiped out mankind previously and make thousands of dollars!
<h3>Step 9</h3>
<p><b>Use Funds from Footage Sale to Mass Produce Mentos</b>
<p>With my newly acquired resources, I will build factories on Mars that will produce a world's supply of Mentos.
<h3>Step 10</h3>
<p><b>Use Mentos to Train Army of Supermutants</b>
<p>I think the title of this step is pretty self-explanatory.
<h3>Step 11</h3>
<p><b>Send Supermutants to Earth and Enforce Martial Law; Crush All Who Resist</b>
<p>With my Space/Time Boats, (Step 10 ½: Build Space/Time Boats, Which Can Travel Easily Through Both Time and Space) I will send my supermutants to Earth to enforce my rule on the planet. I will instruct supermutants to crush all opposition with large crushing devices (Step 10 ¾: Mount Large Crushing Devices on Supermutants).

<h4>So, as you can all plainly see, it's only a matter of time before I rule this pesky planet and sacrifice your pathetic lives to benefit me!
