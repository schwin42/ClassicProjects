<h1>Rob's Guide to Alaska</h1>
 </div><div align="Center"> 
<h4>As a contrast to the usual pointless content on my web site, I decided 
to write an article that might actually be useful to someone maybe. So I present
to you, Rob's Guide to Alaska! In this article, I will touch on the places,
people, climate, exports, and attractions that you may or may not find in
Alaska.</h4>
 
<h4> </h4>
 </div>
 
<div align="Center"> 
<h3>The Places</h3>
 </div>
  As far as I can discern, there are only 4 cities of Alaska, all with a
population of 15+. Though the cities' names escape me, I can assure you that
they were all quite boring and lame. Each town consisted of about 3 houses,
a church, and a about 80 bazillion shops that sold a "wide" variety of "souvenirs." 
<br>
 One interesting thing about Alaska is that if you wander out of the confines 
of civilization, you are immediately halted by huge towering structures 
that the natives call "mountains." These "mountains" are unique in the sense 
that they have no doors or windows with which to enter. I suppose this has 
been taken as a security measure by the people who dwell inside. <br>
 
<div align="Center"> 
<h3>The People</h3>
 </div>
 For the purposes of this article, I tried to get an interview with one of 
the Mountain People who supposedly lived in aforementioned "mountains". Unfortunately, 
as the Mountain People are extremely elusive, all I could get was an interview 
with one of the natives who had an extensive knowledge of them. <br>
 
<p><b>Me:</b> So tell me, sir, when was your first encounter with the elusive 
Mountain People? </p>
 <b>Native Alaskan:</b> What? <br>
 <br>
 <b>Me:</b> So tell me, sir, when was your first encounter with the elusive 
Mountain People? <br>
 <br>
 <b>Native Alaskan:</b> No, I heard you, I just didn't- <br>
 <br>
 <b>Me:</b> I see, so you are trying to waste my time? <br>
 <br>
 <b>Native Alaskan:</b> Waste your time? But you were- <br>
 <br>
 <b>Me:</b> You're in cahoots with the Mountain People, aren't you? <br>
 <br>
 <b>Native Alaskan:</b> What are you talking- <br>
 <br>
 <b>Me:</b> Aren't you!? <br>
 <br>
 After that, he tried to run away, but I was able to subdue him and put him 
in a sack. I had written down an itinerary concerning what I was supposed 
to do after I'd put him in the sack, but I lost it. I also lost the sheet 
of paper with the location that I left that sack when I got bored of looking 
for the itinerary. <br>
 But enough about the mountain people. After monitoring the goings-on in
a typical Alaskan city, I was able to figure out that 98% of the people in 
Alaska are tourists, and the other 2% are outcasts from the rest of the planet, 
thus making Alaska a hole of worthlessness that no one should ever go to.* 
<br>
 *Note to people from Alaska: The previous statement was in regard to a different 
Alaska on a different planet.**<br>
 **Note to people that do not live in Alaska: I'm really not.<br>
 
<div align="Center"> 
<h3>The Climate</h3>
 
<div align="Left">Contrary to popular belief, Alaska is a very cold place. 
Of course, when I say "very cold", I am grossly underexaggerating. Imagine 
walking to a freezer buck naked, on Pluto, in a snowstorm. Obviously, it is
somewhat impossible for a snowstorm to exist centralized inside of a freezer, 
but yes, it's that cold. If you are ever looking to get away from it all and
are staggeringly unintelligent, Alaska is the place.<br>
 <br>
 
<div align="Center"> 
<h3>The Exports</h3>
 
<div align="Left">It seems to me that the chief exports of Alaska are as follows:
mangled pieces of wood that "resemble" various animals, shot glasses with
comical illustrations, and ice. Now, you're probably wondering what more
any person would want from a state, but I contest that this is surprisingly 
little for a state of Alaska's size. You see, while all the other 49 states
are pulling their weight economically, Alaska is selling snow cones and the
like global wide and making a gross profit of $6 yearly. My advice to Alaska
is to start programs that support more profitable ventures, such as BEF (Burning
Eskimos for Fuel) and WAGHLOLKBIF (We Are Going to Hurt Little Kids Because
It's Fun).<br>
<div align="Center">
<h3>The Attractions</h3>
There are no attractions in Alaska. Sorry.<br>
<div align="Left"><br>
<h4>Well, that concludes my article, and I hope you've learned as much as
I have. Though I don't know why I'd learn anything, because I wrote the article
from my previous knowledge and fragments of dreams I had. Anyway, I do have
one last thing to show you. Yes, I will now exhibit some of the incredible
photos I took while in Alaska!</h4>
<div align="Center">
<h4><img src="http://didyousee.itgo.com/graphics/dogsonleash.jpg" alt="Pic #1" width="300" height="206"></h4>
As you can see by this sign, Alaskan have an unhealthy intolerance for fecal
matter of any kind.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="http://didyousee.itgo.com/graphics/burgerqueen.jpg" alt="Pic #2" width="500" height="348"><br>
There may be some hope for Alaskans yet, as they have ingeniously come to
the conclusion that you will sell burgers if you have a monarch in establishment's
name. <br>
<br>
<div align="Center">
<h4>Well, that's all I have on Alaska. For more information, consult your
local library. But they'll probably tell you horrible lies about Alaska and
crush your bones to make their bread. Or something, I dunno. </h4>
