<h1>My Life Insofar</h1>
<h4>Hello. Rob here once again to explain a lot of things. First, why my web site is growing cyber-mold (asides from the reason that it is a very moist and ideal place for cyber-mold). And second... well, I dunno. Maybe I'll think of that once I start the article.
<h3>Why This Web Site Hasn't Been Updated in 30 Eons</h3></center>
<p>It's summer, people, what the hell do you want from me?
<p>Uh... I mean, I have been very busy lately. Perhaps I should elaborate on this, as most people will just assume I'm telling yet another one of my lies.
<p>Well, first of all, I was in a play. That's right, me, Rob, was in a play, <u>Taming of the Shrew</u>! I had like a gazillion lines to memorize in 4/5ths of a second. But I think I pulled it off pretty masterfully. The movie offers should be rolling in any day now.
<p>Secondly, I've been going places and doing things. Or vice versa. I dunno, I can't really remember. Yeah, well, I still stand by my excuse that it's summer. Summer only comes once a year! I should right a poem about summer. It's so great. As a matter of fact, I think I will.
<p><center><i>Oh summer.
<p>How I love summer.
<p>Summer's pretty good, I guess.
<p>Hey hey hey.
<p>Summer. Yeah yeah yeah.
<p>Rhymes with summer.
<p>Hey hey hey.</center></i>
<p>I'll probably win an Oscar for that one! Well, now that all that's out of the way, I can get down to the real point of the article! ...Just as soon as I find out what that is.
<h3>My Life</h3>
<p>I guess this should be somewhere in here, since that's sorta the title of the article and all.
<p>Well, people, I'm not one to fabricate the truth (he said, blatantly lying) so I'm just going to flat out tell you that my life has been one big bucket of hell since my father died. I think I've taken it pretty well, as I've only had to see my (talentless hack of a) psychiatrist twice!
<p>But it's really no laughing matter, folks. If you have family that you don't hate, please don't take them for granted.
<p>Anyway, on a lighter note, I- ...um, oh! I'm updating the web site! That's certainly something to be happy about! Unless, of course, you actually <u>read</u> the crap on this site, in which case, it's more bad news.
<p>Yeah well, so anyway, I just wanted to tell my loyal viewers (if you're reading this, you're one of them) thanks for hanging in there and I give you my humble word (which can be redeemed for 1/100th of a cent cash value) that updates will be frequent and bountiful now that summer's nearly over.
<h3>Whatever I Missed</h3>
<p>After not making an episode for an extremely long time, I took a look at Spasm Boy. I hope it's because of the severe depression, but the episodes look really pathetic.
<p>Additionally, I will try to get a <u>real</u> article up here sometime this week.
