<h1>---Tomb Raider Review---</h1></center>
<center><h3>Plot</center></h3>
<p>Arite, the movie starts off with a really kickass scene, and I won't spoil it. In short, Lara fights this bigass robot (as seen in commercials) and manages to shoot it a bunch of times in an astonishing display of kickassness. A lot of people may disagree with me, but this opening scene rivals the last few scenes in M:I-2 and possibly even the subway scene in the Matrix.
<p>Then, for some reason, Lara takes a shower. Do not bash the shower seen for it accounts for 80% of the breasts rating that this movie received. Needless to say, this was one of my favorite scenes. Yes, I am well aware that I am pathetic. What of it?
<p>After this, like some soda left out in the sun for 6 months, the movie falls flat. The movie takes an <u>extremely</u> long time to explain the "storyline" which is about as thin as a sheet of paper cut in half, so that it's even thinner. And it's also on some sort of weight loss plan. Yeah, that thin. So the viewer is saturated with some nonsensical tripe of a plot. But, if you have to sit through a bunch of illogical garbage, it's a lot easier to take from Angelina Jolie.
<p>So anyway, like a half hour later, we're treated to another action scene. Though not as supremely cool as the first one (and doesn't even come close to anything in the Matrix) it's still pretty cool to look at.
<p>Then some more boring crap happens and I think she goes to Africa or India or Canada or somewhere like that. She fights some clay demons and stuff in an unspectacular display. At this point, I was rather dissappointed that the movie was already going downward.
<p>I don't really want to get into it, but the ending is extremely predictable (and might I add, anticlimactic). Except for the fist fight which, while not really fitting, still looked pretty damn cool. Of course, everything after this is just supremely and utterly lame. If you see the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about.
<p>It recently occured to me that in everything above, I failed to mention even the most basic part of the plot. Oh well, it wasn't that great anyway.
<center><h3>Hero(es) & Villain(s)</h3>
</center><p>Hero- Lara Croft, played by Angelina Jolie. I guess she's off to save the world or something.
<p>Villains-
Some guy who's name I can't remember. He wasn't really that important anyway. Now that I think about it, I don't even know if he *had* a name.
<center><h3>Best Scene</h3>
</center><p>
Hands down, the opening sequence. From the robot confrontation to the shower scene. That's right, the first 15 or so minutes of the movie are like a zillion times better than the rest of it.
<center><h3>---Summary---
<h4>Guns- 8
<p>Yeah, they're everywhere in the movie, though I gave this movie an 8 in this area, because they weren't used to their fullest potential. Some of the gunfights were just... lacking.
<h4><center>Explosions- 3
</center><p>It seems like this type of movie would have explosions in it, though I can't remember any, per se...
<h4><center>Breasts- 7
</center><p>You'd think that the director would have more gratuitous boob shots when directing a movie based on the game Tomb Raider. But other than the shower scene, I was disappointed.
<h4><center>Other- 6
</center><p>It wasn't bad, it wasn't great. There were cool scenes, there were lame scenes. But from what I'd seen in the commercials, I was expecting something awesome, not something decent.
.<center><h2>Total Score- 6
</center></h2><p>More action, less sorry attempt at plot. What were they thinking?
