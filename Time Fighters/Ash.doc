Ash

	The Time Fighters find Ash. His powerful strength was recognized and he was made part of the group. Ash is a lot like Miri in a lot of ways, but a bit gentler. Tough when he wants to be, Ash, most of the time, thinks about situations. He learns from his mistakes by dwelling on them. The only thing about Ash is that scares the other group members because he carries around an ax.
